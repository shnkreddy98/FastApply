that are undesirable or unsafe. We are based in Sunnyvale, CA, and require 5
days/week in-office collaboration. It’s time to build.

We are looking for an experienced **Data Engineer** to develop and optimize
our data processing infrastructure and tools, enabling deep insights from
robotic system logs.In this role you will transform robot logs and other
sources of data to extract information, identify patterns, provide access to
the data and visualization tools. Your work will help ensure that the robot is
operating reliably at maximum performance, and inform engineering design
trades and decisions.

### **Responsibilities:**

  * Develop and maintain pipelines and tools to transform robot logs to make it easier to access, visualize, and automatically detect events of interest. 
  * Optimize data processing to reduce the time needed between data offload and the availability of the data to our engineering teams.
  * Design and optimize data storage solutions for handling complex, high-volume time-series and structured data.
  * Build and maintain database schemas and queries to support analytics and visualization of extracted patterns.
  * Support mechanical, electrical, software, integration and test engineers with their needs to extract and visualize data.
  * Develop dashboards and custom data visualizations tools to enable engineers to quickly extract information from the data and track robot performance.
  * Integrate your solutions with existing data pipelines and our robot testing framework.

### **Requirements:**

  * Bachelor's or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Data Engineering, or a related field.
  * 3+ years of experience in data engineering, preferably with time-series or log data processing.
  * Proficiency in Python with experience in Pandas, Polars, or PySpark for large-scale data processing.
  * Strong understanding of database design, indexing, and query optimization (SQL and NoSQL).
  * Experience handling complex data formats such as Parquet, MCAP, or protobuf.
  * Experience building custom web based data visualization tools (JavaScript, React…)
  * Familiarity with data visualization tools like Grafana for real-time analysis and monitoring.
  * Experience with distributed computing frameworks and cloud-based data storage solutions.
  * Strong debugging skills and ability to work with lab teams to interpret robotic system logs.

### **Bonus Qualifications:**

  * Experience with CI/CD pipelines for automated data processing.
  * Knowledge of robotics or embedded system logging frameworks.
  * Familiarity with real-time data streaming and event-driven architectures.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is between $150,000 -
$250,000 annually.

The pay offered for this position may vary based on several individual
