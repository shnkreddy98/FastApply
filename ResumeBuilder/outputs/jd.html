Deel and our family of growing companies are made up of global teams dedicated to helping businesses hire anyone, anywhere, easily.&nbsp;

The team comprises over three thousand self-driven individuals spanning over 100 countries, and our unified yet diverse culture keeps us continually learning and innovating the platform and products for customers.

Companies should be able to hire the best talent anywhere in the world, so we are building the best platform to make that a reality.
